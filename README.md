# Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch

This repository contains the code and resources for building a Handwritten Digits Classifier using PyTorch. This project is a classic example of image classification using deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9. This type of model has a wide range of applications, including optical character recognition (OCR) systems and digit recognition in various fields.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.6+
PyTorch (latest version)
torchvision (latest version)
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running notebooks)
You can install the required packages using pip:

### bash
Copy code
<pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib>
Dataset
We will use the famous MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set, with 60,000 and 10,000 images, respectively. PyTorch provides easy access to this dataset through its torchvision library.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

**data/:** Contains the data loading and preprocessing code.
**models/:** Includes the PyTorch model architecture.
**train.ipynb:** A Jupyter Notebook for training the model.
**evaluate.ipynb:** A Jupyter Notebook for evaluating the model's performance.
**utils.py:** Utility functions for data loading and visualization.
**Training the Model**
To train the model, run the train.ipynb notebook. This notebook will load the MNIST dataset, define and train the CNN model, and save the trained model's weights for future use.

## Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the model's performance, run the evaluate.ipynb notebook. This notebook will load the trained model and test it on the test dataset, providing accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Results
Our model achieves an accuracy of over 98% on the MNIST test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in handwritten digit classification.

## Usage
You can use the trained model to classify your own handwritten digits. Modify the predict function in evaluate.ipynb to load your image and obtain predictions.
